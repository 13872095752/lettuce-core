              lettuce 3.0.Final RELEASE NOTES

I'm pleased to announce the lettuce 3.0.Final release. Lettuce is a scalable
thread-safe Redis client providing both synchronous and asynchronous
connections. Multiple threads may share one connection provided they avoid
blocking and transactional operations such as BLPOP, and MULTI/EXEC. Multiple
connections are efficiently managed by the excellent netty NIO framework.
Support for advanced Redis features such as Sentinel, Cluster and Redis data
models are included.
