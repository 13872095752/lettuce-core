              lettuce 3.2.Final RELEASE NOTES

This release features unix domain sockets on linux-x86_64 systems. Local connections to a redis instance are now possible
without the use of network.

We tested lettuce using YourKit for performance. Subtracting all IO the most time is spent on constructing the return futures and command objects.
The async API can issue about 300Kops/sec whereas the sync API performs about 13Kops/sec (GET's, PING's) on a single thread.
Sync performance depends on the Redis performance (tested on a Mac, 2,7 GHz Intel Core i7).

lettuce is built with Java 8 but can be used with Java 6, 7 and 8. Java 6 and 7 support will be dropped with lettuce 4.0.
The new lettuce-testcontainer project ensures until then. You can find the build results at https://travis-ci.org/mp911de/lettuce-testcontainer

Unix Domain Sockets
-----
Unix Domain Sockets are useful only if connecting locally and maintaining the connection point on your own. Using RedisClusterClient with Unix Domain Sockets would connect to the local node using a socket and then open TCP connection to all the other hosts. A good example is connecting locally to a standalone or a single cluster node to gain performance.

Unix Domain Socket connections are currently limited to Linux x86_64 systems with a minimum netty version of 4.0.26.Final. You can, however, port the native library to your system. The netty guys would appreciate.

Enhancements
-----
* Provide an option to connect to Redis via Unix Domain Sockets #52
* Add new cluster command MYID #53 (Thanks to @taer)

Fixes
-----
* RedisPubSubConnectionImpl.activated does not call super.activated() #55

Other
------
* Inspect lettuce using YourKit #54


lettuce requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and Java 6 run. It is tested continuously against Redis 3.0.
